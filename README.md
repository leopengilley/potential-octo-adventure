# Pokemon

https://stark-reaches-80757.herokuapp.com/

This project aimed to create a simple Pokémon battle game where users can choose a few Pokémon and battle random CPU Pokémon. The project is aims to use a CRUD system.

## Motivation

I wanted to create something fun that explores the databases and the CRUD system.

## Technology used

* Ruby on rails was used with postgresql.

* I used the PokeApi and gem to access information about pokemon.

* Jquery and Javascript were used to create the game.

* I originally used the wget webscraper to download the animations, but heroku didn't allow the large file size.

* HTTParty accessed the json data from the PokeApi.
